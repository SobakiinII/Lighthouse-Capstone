# Capstone Project: The Evolution and Ongoing Decline of Yu-Gi-Oh

## Background
Yu-Gi-Oh is a japanese trading card game, widely regarded as among the top three tcgs in the world with Pokemon and Magic the Gathering.

I am a long time fan, so the game is near to my heart, and I wanted to use hard data to analyze some concerns I have with the game.

## Questions

Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel, a video game that is the official digital way to play the game, released two years ago. 
In that time it has lost 90% of its average player count

Video essays of longtime players quitting and new players struggling with the game's complexities are concerningly frequent.

Master Duel itself is free to play and very generously monetized, so the issue should hide in the game itself.

In this analysis, I set out to answer three questions to check if the most common complaints are grounded:
- Is the game difficult for newcomers?
- Is the game overly complex even once learned?
- Is the physical card game too expensive?

## The Process
Dataset provided by the free card database API of fan site YGOProDeck.com

Using my existing knowledge of the game, I will break the cards into smaller datasets to compare qualities of the cards.
By visualizing the cards as data points, I can reasonably track the game's complexity by referencing the data with the game rules.

## The Results

### Newcomers and the Learning Cliff

I will open this with the knowledge that Yu-Gi-Oh is different than most TCGs, as it doesn't have a concept called 'set rotation'.
Essentially what that means is that all 12.5 thousand plus cards can be played in an official tournament setting, provided it isnt banned.

Further, there is no play cost in Yu-Gi-Oh, no mana or energy. So long as a card says you can do something, you can do it.
